A,b,b,Uh-huh.  /
A,sv,sv,I think a lot of it's industrial.  /

A,sd,sd,"I, I, I heard a story a while back  /"
A,sd,sd,"something to the effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent, or, take all the cars off the road that have been, uh, manufactured say before nineteen seventy-five,"
B,b^r,b,Uh-huh. /
A,+,+,that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just by getting rid of those cars that are still left remaining. /
B,qy,qy,"You mean, uh, fifty percent pollution total --"
A,ny,ny,Yeah. /

A,%,%,okay. /
B,bk,bk,"Oh, uh-huh. /"
A,sv,sv,"So, that I think would be tremendous help.  /"
A,sd,sd,But I happen to drive an old model car because it's very economical  /

A,sd,sd,and I don't have an incentive to get rid of it as long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money. /
B,b,b,Uh-huh. /
A,sv,sv,On the other hand I know it's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars I have. /
B,b,b,Uh-huh. /
A,sd,sd,But I don't have any incentive to get out of it until it dies. /
B,b,b,Right. /

A,ny^r,ny,"oh, uh, yeah,  /"
A,sv,sv,"it's, it's, uh, pretty heavy up here I think  /"

A,%,%,"And, and, uh, {pause} - /"
A,sv,sv,"and, uh, uh, people, uh, I don't think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should.  /"

A,sd,sd,"my wife's a registered nurse,  /"
A,sv,sv,"and I think this state was like second this year from the top, in terms of, uh, cancer rate for just all kinds.  /"
A,sv,sv,And I can't help but believe that's not partially caused from pollution.  /
A,sv,sv,"I just don't know exactly what it necessarily is,  /"
A,sv,sv,but I just can't believe it is. /
B,b,b,Um. /
A,sd,sd,"Now we have a lot of pollution being caused by cloruph-, uh, fluorocarbons which is the, like freon twelve and freon twenty-two.  /"
A,sd,sd,"They use freon twenty-two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps, /"
B,b,b,Uh-huh. /
A,sd,sd,and they use freon twelve in car air conditioners  /
A,sv,sv,and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose it's ozone layer. /
B,b^r,b,Uh-huh. /
A,sv,sv,"And I can't help believe if it's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose it's ozone layer, that it's not acting as a pollutant in our lungs also,  /"

A,%,%,and. -/
B,qw,qw,"Well what can we do about the, the, the, the air conditioning problem? /"
A,sd,sd,"Well they're working now, - /"
A,sd,sd,"I know DuPont and Dow and several other chemical companies are working, uh, feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons, /"
B,b,b,Uh-huh. /
A,sv,sv,"and who ever does is going to make, uh, a mint.  /"
A,sd,sd,"Because if they ever come up with a reasonable working agent in place of fluorocarbons, then, uh, -/"
B,qy,qy,"Is that also what's in, uh, hairsp-, aerosol? /"
A,na,na,"Well they used to be,  /"
A,sd,sd,but they made them take it out of that. /
B,qy^d,qy^d,"Even, so, so the aerosol is still aerosol, /"
A,na,na,Right. /
B,qy^d,qy^d,but it doesn't have anything that's damaging. /
A,nn,nn,"No,  /"
A,sd^e,sd,"they, they, they passed a law and made them take the fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers, /"
B,b,b,"Uh-huh,  /"
B,sv,sv,well that's good. /
A,sv,sv,and that was a move in the right direction.  /
A,sd,sd,We are doing some things to try to correct the problem.  /
A,sv,sv,But there are more things we could do  /
A,sv,sv,"and getting rid of old cars, like I said is one way to help correct the problem.  /"
A,sv,sv,"Uh, uh, just trying to I think be careful, uh, with the way you handle garbage,  /"
A,sd,sd,"I notice in this state, - /"
A,sd,sd,"I don't know if you're doing it in Texas yet or not,  /"

A,sd,sd,well we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too.  /
A,%,%,"But they, uh, - /"
A,sd,sd,"in one of the counties here, they're actually doing a trial program of having a trash police.  /"
A,sd,sd,They have a lady that goes around like a meter maid  /

B,ba,ba,"No kidding,  /"

A,+,+,they'll fine you fifty bucks I think the first time and two fifty the second time. /

A,%,%,"you, - /"
A,b,b,"right,  /"
A,sv,sv,"you've got to get people to see i-, - /"
A,sv,sv,"and surprisingly enough just handling of trash, uh, can cut pollution, uh, from, uh, uh, from just throwing it in a dump, or, or, or, where ever else they used to do with it, maybe used to burn it.  /"
A,sd,sd,They've stopped that up here too. /
B,b,b,Uh-huh. /
A,sv,sv,"But that, that will cut pollution too.  /"

A,sd,sd,"for instance cans and bottles, they never go away at all. /"
B,b,b,Uh-huh. /
A,sv,sv,"But on, on the other hand, I don't guess they're polluting.  /"

A,sd,sd,I'm not sure of that. /

A,sv,sv,Oh I think that's very important to do. /
B,%,%,(( )) too. /
A,sv,sv,"I, I really think that, uh, trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very, very important thing. /"
B,b,b,Uh-huh. /
A,sv,sv,"And, uh, that can help to cut pollution, I guess some.  /"
A,sv,sv,"I, I don't know how much trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air.  /"
A,sv,sv,"I would hope that they would help some, though.  /"
A,sv,sv,That's for sure. /
B,sv,sv,"I think, uh, it seems like there was something going on, around here, that, you know, -/"
A,x,x,<Throat_clearing>. /
B,sd,sd,"we have all these chemical plants and oil refineries and those kind of things and that they burn off a lot of stuff, /"
A,b,b,Uh-huh. /
B,sd,sd,"and some of the stuff that they weren't supposed to do that somebody found out, you know, like in the middle of the night, they would go ahead and do it anyway.  /"
B,sd,sd,I think they got caught. /
A,ba,ba,Oh good. /
B,sd,sd,"But I wonder how much of that kind of stuff, you know, goes on. /"
A,sv,sv,"Well that, uh, that I think may go on a lot  /"
A,sv,sv,"and the primary reason I think it may go on a lot is just as you said, somebody happened to stay up late at night or something.  /"
A,sv,sv,"I don't think we have a adequate policing, uh, particularly on industry.  /"
A,sv,sv,"Uh, we have good policing, at least in this state  and, and several of the surrounding states and probably yours too, of car pollutants  /"
A,sd,sd,"because we have to go down, uh, once a year here in Maryland and get out car's exhaust systems checked for emission content. /"
B,sd,sd,"Uh, we have to, uh, we have to have a state inspection every year. /"
A,b,b,Uh-huh. /

B,%,%,"or, -/"
A,no,no,"I don't know,  /"
A,sd,sd,"uh, that's something that you'd have to just check with your authorities.  /"
A,sd,sd,"But in this state we have to, uh, pay eight dollars and a half and go to a, an emission station once a year and get every one of our cars checked that are, have been made starting in nineteen seventy-three. /"

A,nn,nn,"No,  /"
A,nn^r,nn,"no,  /"
A,sd^e,sd,we don't have inspections like that.  /
A,sd,sd,"Now, I'm in Maryland,  /"
A,sv,sv,"in Virginia they check that every two years, I think. /"
B,sd,sd,"We do that ev-, every year. /"
A,sv,sv,"And I think that's a good idea too,  /"
A,sd,sd,"not, no-, not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution necessarily,  /"
A,sv,sv,but I think it's a good idea.  /
A,sd,sd,"The emission check, though, is required in Maryland  /"
A,sd,sd,"and it's also required in Virginia, uh, a sister state to, to this one.  /"
A,sv,sv,"And that's, that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants. /"
B,sd,sd,"Well I'll have to check,  /"
